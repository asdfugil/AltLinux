## Getting Started

Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

### Issues and Discussions

For script questions or problems ,you can create Issues or Discussions

- Please don't create any issues or Discueesion which have no association to the script
- If the issues solved or you got the answer,remeber to close it ;)
- For features request,publish it in Discussions,if it's useful ,me or others contributors might add this

- Write a description that what's done in the request,like what you fixed or added or improved
- Test it before create pull requests,please make sure it's workable 

### Forks

Only several things you have to notice

- Please don't do any chnages to the author line
- But you can add a line below author line : "*YOUR_NAME* forked this from powenn/AltServer-Linux-ShellScript on github" 
- For contributor who did a nice pull request and got merged,you will be added to the contributors line

For a real example,there is someone forked this repo ,and copied codes written from others in pull request,then said himself is the author,but actually he didn't do any contributons 
to this repo or wrote some useful codes ,all of them were copied from others and only do unusefully modifications,anyway if you are a shameless people you still can do that
