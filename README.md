# AltShell (Originally AltServer-Linux-ShellScript)

This is merely a fork to see if I can get the program running on Ubuntu 22.04 x64.

## Get started
Run the following command in your terminal to install the dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install usbmuxd libimobiledevice6 libimobiledevice-utils wget curl libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
```
Run the following command to start the script:
```
./run.sh
```
