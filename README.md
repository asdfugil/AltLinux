# AltShell (Originally AltServer-Linux-ShellScript)

This is merely a fork to see if I can get the program running on Ubuntu 22.04 x64.

## Get started
Run the following command in your terminal to install the dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install usbmuxd libimobiledevice6 libimobiledevice-utils wget curl libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
```
Run the following command to start the script:
```
./run.sh
```  

## Running the program
Type "p" to pair your device.  
Accept the trust dialog on the screen of your device, then type "p" again.  
Then type "i". Choose option 1 if you want to install AltStore.  
IMPORTANT: type your e-mail in **lowercase** letters, otherwise it might not work.
